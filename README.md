### :man_technologist: About Me :

I'm Samuel Braz Pinto, currently I'm doing my Master's Degree in Computer Science and Engineering at Instituto Superior Técnico, Lisbon. I am specializing in Videogames, and aim to land a job in the gaming industry as a designer or programmer.

- 🎮 I enjoy doing game jams, and games with longer development time. I also like doing small projects to experiment with novel game mechanics, that mostly never see the daylight.

- 🎲 I'm contributing to a student-made videogame, Project Star, as Leader Designer and Lead Writer.

- :musical_note: I love music, ranging from Pop to Metal and Classical. I also like art, including contemporary, and design. And obviously, I love to play games. :smiley:

- 🗣️ Always free to talk, if you have any question or you'd like to work with me, feel free to contact me!
